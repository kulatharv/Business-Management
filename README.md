The software uses a MySQL database with tables to store and manage data for each module. Below are the sample database tables for Sales and Inventory:

### Example: `sales` table
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sales_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    product_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    sale_date DATE,
    total_amount FLOAT,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES inventory(product_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
Example: inventory table
sql

CREATE TABLE inventory (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    quantity_in_stock INT,
    price FLOAT
);
